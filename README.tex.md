# ElectSym

Project to provide a library with electoral computations to do different simulations

## Divisors Methods

One electoral method is that of [Divisors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highest_averages_method)

It needs a strictly increasing sequence of real numbers:

$f:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{R}$ such that $n > m \implies f(n) > f(m)$
